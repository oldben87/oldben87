- 👋 Hi, I’m @oldben87
- 👀 I’m interested in React, React-Native, Typescript, Node.js, GraphQL, Postgres. I would love to start up learning more about docker, kubernetes, and the whole micro-service architecture. Either in AWS or GCP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to the above topics. 

- List of my projects:
  - ArfiDiary: [Link to website](https://www.arfidiary.co.uk).
  This is a food diary for people suffering with the eating disorder [ARFID](https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/get-information-and-support/about-eating-disorders/types/arfid/)
  Currently this is released on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arfid&gl=GB) as a Beta project, available for anyone to download.
  A REST server is with a PostgresDB on Heroku. (If you use the mobile app please give the server a chance to fire up.)

- Windows Games: [Link to website](https://windows-games.herokuapp.com) [Link to repo](https://github.com/oldben87/windows-games)
  - I thought it would be fun to try to remake some of the classic windows games. So far I have made rough versions of Minesweeper and Solitaire.
